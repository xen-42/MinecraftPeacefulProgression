# Peaceful Progression

Makes blocks/item/dimensions available in peaceful difficulty that require mob drops in vanilla, by adding new ores, crops, mobs, and behaviours. This enables most progression to be done in peaceful mod like getting an Elytra from the End islands and crafting beacons. Enables hunger in peaceful with no negative effects (purely cosmetic).

Adds new methods to acquire the following drops: Gunpowder, saddles, bones, blaze rods, breeze rods, ender pearls, froglights, slime balls, resin, phantom membranes, ghast tears, string, spider eyes, mob heads, prismarine shards, prismarine crystals, tide armor trim smithing template, nether stars, tridents, nautilus shells, wither roses, rotten flesh.

- Bats can be lured and bred with watermelon. They drop bat wings on death, and randomly drop guano.
